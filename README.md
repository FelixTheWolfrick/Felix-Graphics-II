# animal3D-SDK-202101SP
animal3D SDK and related course frameworks for spring 2021.

# Project requirements checklist:
1. Ability to change texture and color
2. Customizable color change effect (ideally can simulate colorblind types)
3. Outline renderer
4. Water-like animator
5. N/A
6. Unity shaders

# Project requirements: These count towards the implementation part of the project: 
The project must include and integrate some elements of each of the main course units in some meaningful way: 

1. General shaders and pipelines; basic shader programs with vertex and fragment shaders; renderer architecture, components and design; fundamental lighting algorithms.
    - Phong shading, multi-light shaders, custom geometry, uniform buffers, etc.

2. Post-processing shaders and pipelines; framebuffers and multi-pass algorithms; intermediate lighting algorithms and effects.
    - Bloom, antialiasing, other post-processing effects; pipeline management systems; etc.

3. Screen-space effects; multiple render targets and intermediate framebuffer applications.
    - Deferred rendering, depth-of-field, motion blur, SSAO, etc.

4. Interpolation algorithms, curves and splines; intermediate shader programs with tessellation and geometry shaders.
    - Catmull-Rom, Bezier and Hermite curves; drawing and reparameterizing curves; level-of-detail; etc.

5. Introductory animation programming concepts.
    - Forward kinematics and pose-to-pose keyframe animation; etc.

6. Advanced topics.
    - Compute shaders; scene culling; custom utilities; etc.
